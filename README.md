# 📌 What It Does

Blocks specified websites during working hours by editing the system's  `hosts` file.

# 📁 Files and Structure

You only need one main Python file:

~~~ruby
website_blocker.py
~~~

# 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.x

- Admin/root privileges (to modify the `hosts` file)

# 🧠 How It Works

- Modifies the hosts file on your system.

- Redirects websites to 127.0.0.1, essentially blocking them.

- Unblocks them after working hours.

# ⚙️ Location of hosts File

- Windows: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`

- Linux/Mac: `/etc/hosts`

 # 🧾 Sample Code

 ~~~ruby
website_blocker.py
~~~

# ⚠️ Note

- Run as Admin/root: You’ll need to run the script with administrative privileges.

- Schedule It: Use Task Scheduler (Windows) or `cron` (Linux/macOS) to run it in the background.

 # ✅ Possible Upgrades
 
- GUI using `tkinter` or `PyQt`

- Add/Remove websites dynamically

- Block based on categories (social, entertainment)

- Notifications or logging

- Add websites, and click Start Blocking.

# 🧠 Optional Enhancements

- Save/load blocked websites list to file

# 🛠️ Steps to Convert to a macOS App

**Step 1: Install PyInstaller**

First, you'll need to install PyInstaller to
~~~ruby
pip install pyinstaller
~~~
**Step 2: Create**

- Navigate to the directory where y

- Run the following command to create a standalone app (this will generate a `.app` fi)

  ~~~ruby
  pyinstaller --onefile --windowed website_blocker_gui.py
  ~~~
- `--onefile`: Pa

- `--windowed`: Preve

This will generate a `dist` folder cwebsite_blocker_.

 ***Step 3:***
 
Once PyInstaller finishes, you should see a .app file in the `dist directoryWebsite GUI jus

***Step 4:***

- If yo

- Creat (if you)

- Open Keychain A andDevelo certi

- Use t
  ~~~ruby
  codesign --sign "Developer ID Application: Your Name (Team ID)" path/to/website_blocker_gui.app
  ~~~

  ***Step 5:***
  
If you want to create a downloadable disk image for distribution, you can package the `.app` file `.dmg` file for

- Install `create-dmg`:
~~~ruby
npm install -g create-dmg
~~~
- Run th
~~~bash
create-dmg "dist/website_blocker_gui.app" "dist/website_blocker_gui.dmg"
~~~

This will generate a `.dmg` file, w

# 🎉 Y

Now you have a standalone macO that runs yo

> [!NOTE]
> If you use an app-level blocker, make sure it is protected from abuse..

> [!TIP]
> Blocking websites may not always be effective, and users can bypass blocking. It is just one tool for increasing security and control.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A real application would require more complex mechanisms for processing requests, filtering, storing a list of blocked sites, etc.

> [!WARNING]
> Warning: Site blockers may conflict with other network and browser settings. Please note potential issues and possible alternative solutions.
